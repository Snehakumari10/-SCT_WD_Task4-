## Features
**Add Tasks:** Users can easily add new tasks with a description and a specific due date.

**Dynamic Task List:** Tasks are displayed in a list that updates in real-time as tasks are added, deleted, or marked as done.

**Task Management:** Each task includes buttons to mark it as "Done," "Reschedule," or "Delete."

**Date Picker:** An integrated date and time picker provides a user-friendly interface for setting task deadlines.

**Visual Feedback:** Tasks marked as "Done" receive a visual indication (e.g., a line-through) to show completion status.

**Responsive Design:** The application is styled to be functional and visually appealing on various devices and screen sizes.


## Technologies Used

HTML5: Used for structuring the application's layout, including the task input form and the dynamic task list.

CSS3: Responsible for the application's styling, creating a clean and modern user interface, and implementing a responsive design.

JavaScript : The core of the application, handling all the logic for adding, updating, and deleting tasks.




## Lessons Learned

**Advanced DOM Manipulation:** I gained practical experience in dynamically creating and appending new HTML elements to the page based on user input.

**Event Handling:** attaching multiple event listeners to different buttons (Done, Reschedule, Delete) and handling their unique functionalities.

**State Management:** I learned to effectively manage the application's state, tracking the status of each task (e.g., pending or done) and ensuring the UI accurately reflects this state.

**Date and Time Manipulation:** I worked with JavaScript's Date object to handle and format due dates, integrating a date picker for a better user experience.

**Form Handling & Validation:** I implemented logic to capture user input from the task description and date fields and process it to create a new task.
